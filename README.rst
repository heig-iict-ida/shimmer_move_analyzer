Shimmer Move Analyzer
.....................
To record gesture templates, the `ShimmerMoveAnalyzer` program can be used. It
allows one to stream accelerometer data from a Shimmer (with the Boilerplate firmware)
over Bluetooth. By clicking on the save button, the user can choose the data
window that will be saved to a text file to be used as a template later on.

Running
.......
This requires Java 1.7.

On Windows/OSX, bluecove (used for bluetooth communication) requires a 32bit JVM. So if you get a bluecove error when running, add the '-d32' option to the java command.

On Linux you need to install libbluetooth-dev.
