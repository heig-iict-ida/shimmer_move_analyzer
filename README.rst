Shimmer Move Analyzer
.....................
To record gesture templates, the `ShimmerMoveAnalyzer` program can be used. It
allows one to stream accelerometer data from a Shimmer (with the Boilerplate firmware)
over Bluetooth. By clicking on the save button, the user can choose the data
window that will be saved to a text file to be used as a template later on.
